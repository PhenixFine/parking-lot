# parking-lot
Creates a parking lot specified by the user, and allows the user to park and remove cars, and list currently parked cars in various ways. The file [StageFive.kt](https://github.com/PhenixFine/parking-lot/blob/master/src/old/StageFive.kt), in the old package, is my final stage for JetBrains Academy Kotlin [Parking Lot project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/75/stages/420/implement). The file [ParkingLot.kt](https://github.com/PhenixFine/parking-lot/blob/master/src/ParkingLot.kt) is a more user friendly version of the challenge.
