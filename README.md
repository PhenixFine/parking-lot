# parking-lot
### My third Kotlin project from JetBrains Academy
Creates a parking lot specified by the user, and allows the user to park and remove cars, and list currently parked cars in various ways.
The file StageFive.kt, in the old package, follows the [requirements](https://hyperskill.org/projects/75/stages/420/implement) for the project challenge. The file ParkingLot.kt is a more user friendly version of the challenge.
